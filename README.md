# Getting Started with Etherspot Prime

This repo serves as the most simple way to get up and running with an Etherspot Prime powered dapp. 

Here we are creating a random key based wallet, and then instantiating the Prime SDK with it.

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm i`

And then 

`npm start`


You can take a look at src/App.tsx to see how we initialise the SDK.
